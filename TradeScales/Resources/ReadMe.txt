Workbench Example 

Workbench Example is a bare bones example application that I've written to serve a dual purposes. 

The first would be to serve as an example of how AvalonDock can be implemented in a MVVM WPF application to create customizable layouts (Similar to what is found in many popular integrated development environments) and secondly the application serves as a nice starting point for any other applications I might like to develop in the future.

The application has a Metro-style user interface with support for multiple variations of themes and accents. 

Libraries used:
1. MahApps.Metro.dll
